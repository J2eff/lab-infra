# 🧪 Local Infrastructure Lab with Packer & Terraform (libvirt)

This repository provides a reusable lab automation framework to build and manage local virtual machines using **Packer** and **Terraform (libvirt)**.

It is designed to serve as the foundation for practicing and testing infrastructure platforms like **MinIO**, **Ceph**, and **Kubernetes** on your local machine.

### 🧩 Detailed Breakdown

- `base/packer/jammy.json`  
  Defines how to build a custom **Ubuntu 22.04 (Jammy Jellyfish)** image using Packer. Includes boot setup, provision scripts, and output settings (e.g., `qcow2` format).

- `base/packer/http/`  
  Contains `user-data` and `meta-data` files used by **cloud-init** during image provisioning. These are served by Packer via `http_directory` to initialize system settings inside the VM.

- `base/packer/scripts/`  
  Shell scripts executed during image build (e.g., install packages, enable SSH, clean up cache). These customize the base image for downstream lab usage.

- `base/terraform/main.tf`  
  Terraform configuration to create local virtual machines using **libvirt**. Useful for spinning up VMs based on the image built with Packer.

- `labs/minio/`  
    Contains configuration files (e.g., Ansible playbooks, inventory, Terraform) for setting up a MinIO lab environment on local VMs.
    This includes automation scripts to deploy a multi-disk, S3-compatible MinIO cluster using the image built via Packer.
    ➕ This structure is extensible — additional labs such as ceph/, k8s/, or vault/ can be added in the same way.

- `Makefile`  
  Provides convenient setup targets:
  - `make prepare` — Installs dependencies, `tfenv`, and `packer`
  - `make configure-libvirt` — Configures `libvirt` and group permissions
  - `make setup-sudoers` — Grants passwordless `sudo` for the current user

## 📚 Blog Series Scope (In Progress)

This repository is currently being initialized and will support a blog series covering:

- 🛠️ **Packer**: Building custom Ubuntu 22.04 VM images using `cloud-init`
- ⚙️ **Terraform (libvirt)**: Creating and managing local VMs using the `libvirt` provider

> 💡 This repo will later be extended with MinIO, Ceph, and Kubernetes lab configurations.
---

## Features

- ✅ Automated build of Ubuntu QCOW2 images using Packer (cloud-init enabled)
- ✅ Local libvirt environment setup and configuration
- ✅ VM provisioning with Terraform (libvirt provider)
- ✅ Ready-to-use for MinIO, Ceph, Kubernetes, and more

---

## 🚀 Getting Started

### 1. Install System Dependencies

```bash
sudo apt update && sudo apt install -y build-essential curl git sudo
```

### 2. Enable Passwordless Sudo for Your User

```bash
make setup-sudoers
exec su -l $(whoami)  # Re-login to apply sudoers change
```

### 3. Prepare Your Environment
```bash
make prepare
exec su -l $(whoami)  # Re-login to apply group memberships (libvirt, kvm)
```

###  4. Build the Base Ubuntu Image
```bash
cd base/packer
packer init ubuntu.pkr.hcl
packer build jammy.json
```

## 💡 Use Cases

This lab environment is ideal for:

- **MinIO Lab** — Deploy a multi-disk, S3-compatible object storage service for testing.
- **Ceph Lab** — Experiment with MON/OSD setup and validate RBD or CephFS configurations.
- **Kubernetes Lab** — Build a local Kubernetes cluster using `kubeadm` for development and experimentation.

The base image built via Packer can be reused across these labs, enabling fast and consistent prototyping.

## 🔁 Philosophy

This repository is built on the following principles:

- Provide a **consistent and minimal base image** for infrastructure labs.
- Enable **repeatable, scriptable workflows** through Makefiles and automation.
- Support **rapid local iteration** on cluster setups without relying on cloud resources.
